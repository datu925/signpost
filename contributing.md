We love pull requests from everyone, but it may be worth checking in with us ahead of time about the current state/status of the project before you go nuts making changes.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/tooltips.git

Make sure the tests pass:

    open jasmine-standalone-2.4.1/SpecRunner.html

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass again.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/datu925/tooltips/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We reserve the right to refuse requests or make substantial edits for any reason.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
